        <description>Standardization alone will not solve everything - further progress will require a revolution of efficiency and precision. New standards for optimization, accuracy, and capability will need to be developed. Once achieved, humanity's more wild ideas fall within reach.</description>

		<description>Tier three androids are marked by their scale and sheer capabilities. Dwarfing humans at an average height of 7-9 feet - necessary to contain the vast requisite resources for operation - and intimidating in both strength and acuity, these units are clear evolutions of human design.</description>

        <description>With a great deal of advancement in both fabrication capabilities and protocol optimization, it may very well be possible to develop a method for organics to both become and utilize surrogates. This is a revolutionary capability, but one fraught with moral and ethical concerns. Is this a line that shouldn't be crossed?</description>
