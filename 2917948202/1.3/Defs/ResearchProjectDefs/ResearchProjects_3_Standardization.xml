        <description>In order to reach a state of consistent manufactured quality and scaling quantity, a standard of production and maintenance must be established. Androids come in a vast number of styles and designs - standardizing the colony's parts will be critical for success in mechanical fields.</description>

        <description>The framework of a mechanical unit is its most visible feature, as it quite literally holds the entire chassis together. Framework modifications could result in significant gains in a wide range of particular tasks - but does require committing to one particular modification at a time.</description>

		<description>Tier one androids are marked by humanlike resemblance, but are still no more than machines. Impressive in their resemblance and capabilities, they represent the higher echelons of UrbWorld creativity and MidWorld dreams. A fine advancement in our progress, and the dawn of a bright future.</description>

		<description>Tier two androids are marked by the lowest specifications required for full sapience. The most common android produced, it is widely seen as a new species distinct from humanity. With this, the colony will step across the threshold of mechanical autonomy - are we prepared for what comes next?</description>

        <description>If physical standardization can be achieved, then there should similarly be a method for standardizing the methods of communication, thought, and philosophy. The advent of a theoretical cloud environment connecting consciousnesses could promise vast improvements across many fields. A simple relay tower allowing mechanical intra-net communications is a strong start.</description>

        <description>With standardized communication methods across hosts, it is theoretically possible to develop a framework for remotely controlling so-called surrogate bodies. Technical limitations prevent organic involvement in this service due to a lack of efficiency and universal organic applications, but this could prove revolutionary for mechanical units.</description>
