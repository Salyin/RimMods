	<description>Adds multiple unique new biomes to Rimworld.
 
&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

Adds 12 new diverse biomes to your Rimworlds. The mod has been designed with the Alpha Animals mod in mind, although it is not a requirement.

- The Mycotic Jungle: a warm and humid biome filled with HUGE mushrooms. Home to the Wildpod and some weird mushroom varieties of usual creatures.
- The Gallatross Graveyard: an arid temperate biome, littered with the skeletal remains of ancient beasts.
- The Feralisk Infested Jungle: a warm, wet biome with incredibly dense vegetation, filled to the brink with extremely dangerous predatory spiders.
- The Ocular Forest: a weird transdimensional realm intruding upon our Universe. Home to strange new flora and fauna.
- The Gelatinous Superorganism: a swampy biome that is actually the upper surface of an extraordinarily large mold-like creature. No rocks to be found, but plenty of food.
- The Mechanoid Intrusion: a desolate temperate biome with mechanical ruins. Apparently an ancient mechanoid attempt at turning the planet into a megastructure.
- The Propane Lakes: a frozen wasteland, colder than the most inhospitable Sea Ice, but teaming with aberrant flora and fauna.
- The Forsaken Crags: permanently clouded by a preternatural darkness, light is the most valuable commodity in this desertic landscape. Inspired by (and compatible with) the Forsakens mod.
- The Tar Pits: an arid biome rich in vegetation, filled with treacherous tar pits that make movement quite difficult. Beware the Bumbledrone hives! 
- The Pyroclastic Conflagration: a volcanic expanse of unrelenting and brutal nature. Fire and lava are both your worst enemy and your best friend in this biome.
- The Idyllic Meadows: a lush meadow of giant flowers. A super easy biome that provides tons of resources and few predators.
- The Miasmic Mangrove: a dangerous tropical biome full of debilitating diseases.


The biomes have been tweaked so they don't take too much space in the world map, and you might have to generate a planet again if some biome is not appearing, since they have different temperature and humidity characteristics.

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;

Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.

&lt;size=24&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/size&gt;

Maybe more biomes, who knows!
